Metaphor

- N stands for .NET
- Wheels stands for wheels being reinvented over and over again by numerous software projects.

Motivation

- Observations made while taking part in various enterprise application development projects:

  - Commonality in the needs of these projects is much higher than variability
    - This applies to both dev/ops/ALM toolchain and processes, and both to the application being developed
    - Most of developers' efforts are not unique, but rather repetitive and mechanical. These can be minimized or completely eliminated.
  
  - Every project invents mostly the same types of wheels for itself. 
    - It takes significant effort and budget to build reliable wheels of good quality.
    - Not every project has enough people on board with proper background and expertise, in order do build the wheels right. Bad quality then hits back.
  
  - Projects that run on a limited budget, and must deliver business value quickly in order to survive (e.g. start-ups), 
    have no choice but to focus solely on delivering business value, at first stages.
  
  - Projects that focus solely on delivering business value, and abandon infrastructural efforts, 
    hit the wall later, as the system grows, more features are requested, and higher evolution rate is expected.
    - What happens then, is that either significant resources are invested into re-engineering of the system, or even more resources are invested in proceeding as is. 

Goals

  - Put an end to enormous waste of resources spent by every project on its own. 
  - Collaborate to build an infrastructural ecosystem that supplies common needs of most of .NET-based enterprise application projects.
  - Let projects work both right and fast from day one.
  - Let projects deliver quickly by minimizing developers efforts on most of the tasks, which are repetitive and mechanical rather than unique. 
  - Make NWheels an attractive option for development of new enterprise applications
  
Strategy and tactics

  - The strategy: 
    - Build a community and collaborate continuously to design and implement NWheels in an iterative process
  
  - The tactics:
    - Provide proof of concept through real applications running in production
    - Reflect on what is done, and define put the high-level architecture right.
    - Start advertising and building community of contributors.
    - Let every wheel be built by developers and architects that have strong background and expertise in relevant subjects.
    - Capture every task in application development process, that can be programmed and automated, and allow delivering significantly more value for significantly less effort.
