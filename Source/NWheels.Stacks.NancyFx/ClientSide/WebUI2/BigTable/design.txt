Analysis:

- Layers:

  1) Source - Local / Server
  2) Structure - None (plain list) / Nested-set tree / Adjacent-set tree
  3) Pagination - None (display all) / Load 1 page at time + navigation / Load more as scrolling down
  4) Virtualization - Turn on as visible row set gets long
  5) Selection - None / Single / Multiple
